<br>
Text Generation with GPT-2
<br>
This project demonstrates how to generate human-like text using OpenAI's GPT-2 language model. GPT-2 is a transformer-based deep learning model trained on a large corpus of text data, capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant text given a prompt.
<br>
The repository includes:
<br>
Setup and installation instructions for the transformers library.
<br>
Preprocessing and tokenization of input text.
<br>
Text generation scripts using different decoding strategies (greedy, top-k, top-p sampling).
<br>
Optional fine-tuning on custom datasets for domain-specific text generation.
<br>
Examples showcasing GPT-2's ability to generate stories, articles, and dialogue.
<br>

Use Cases
<br>
Creative writing and story generation
<br>
Chatbots and conversational AI
<br>
Code or documentation generation
<br>
Content assistance tools
<br>

This project is ideal for exploring how large language models can be applied to real-world text generation tasks using Python and the Hugging Face Transformers library.
